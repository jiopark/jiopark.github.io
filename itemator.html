						<b>Problem</b><br>
						Receipt itemizations is one of the largest pain points for Concur power users. Users who travel frequently or incur expenses nearly everyday. Many executive and C-levels have their own assistants whose primary jobs are to log and submit expenses. <br><br>
						Hotel bills especially, are difficult to scan, which means users often have to manually input all individual expenses, from hotel lodging expenses to room service to small surcharges and fees. Not to mention, the current user flow makes it impossible to review itemizations before processing it to the cloud. The overall flow is slow, inaccurate and difficult to gather accurate data from. Most users, in their frustration, roll up all their expenses to save time. <br><br>

						<b>Research</b><br>
						I worked with the data science team, a group of developers and product managers to gather research and data on the current process for receipt itemizations. 
						<br><br>
						I whiteboarded a user journey map, interviewed users to describe their own process through the various steps. There were numerous issues that came up throughout the user journey that needed to be addressed with the new receipt capture flow. Subsequently, we designed a flow that worked with better OCR scanning and much faster processing time. <br><br>

					<p><br>
						<b>Outcome</b><br>
						The project started out as just hotel itemizations, but it eventually tackled an even broader issue: scanning & processing all receipts, more accurately and quickly.<br><br>
						<b>New Feature: Auto Capture</b><br>
						By using more accurate OCR and continuously scanning multiple frames of a receipt, the <span style="text-decoration:underline wavy #C47F66;">confidence</span> level (level of confidence reading the information on a receipt) improved from 20~ to 80%. Although the process still isn't perfect in detecting finer details such as vendor, date, city, it's a large improvement in terms of accuracy, speed and user experience. <br><br>
						The final beta is a smoother flow and faster process compared to its predecessor. A major improvement in the processing time, which used to take 5-15 minutes shortened to under 30 seconds. Receipt scanning is not only more accurate but faster, making it easier to input itemizations, measure data and make even further improvements.

						<b>Next steps</b><br>
						The app was for demoed for keynotes at Concur's annual conferences, including Fusion North America and Fusion EMEA. There has been improved confidence and data collection from faster processing time and more accurate inputting on the users' end. Further development has been made and the features has been put into production on a Concur beta mobile platform.
