		<p>The Adaptable App was created in order to help with disaster prevention/preparation, disaster relief and to increase climate awareness. Disaster prevention and preparation is recorded by checklists and badges based on activity on the app. Awareness is raised by keeping users up to date with news articles relevant to their area on the home page.</p>

		<p>The Adaptable App is a way to get the user involved with their surrounding climate and show them ways to make a difference in their daily lives. An additional feature we worked on was a 'friends list' in order to allow users to see how their loved ones were doing, if family and/or friends lived in a different city, region or country.</p>
