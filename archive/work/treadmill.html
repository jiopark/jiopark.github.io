		<p>Treadmills are notorious for having bad UI. I wanted to redesign something that was more motivating and easier to use.</p>
		<img src="images/ui-0.png">
		<img src="images/ui-0a.png">
		<p>Early draft phases included re-arranging the data and picking out what I thought was the most important part of the UI.</p>
		<img src="images/ui-1.png">
		<p>Welcome screen - simple start up and inspirational background images.</p>
		<img src="images/ui-2.png">
		<p>User information set-up page: Any changes made to the data is always done with the buttons on the right in order to create continuity and consistency. (Can be switched for left-handed users)</p>
		<img src="images/ui-3.png">
		<p>Whatever data is chosen, that circle is the biggest on the screen.</p>
		<img src="images/ui-4.png">
		<p>Post-Workout: Rewards user with badges of achievement and fun information related to their workout.</p>
		<p>After months of research, several user testing phases I redesigned a UI that was flatter, cleaner and simpler. It takes into consideration motivation, treadmill safety and ease of use.</p>
